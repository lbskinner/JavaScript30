      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2); // output 100 100
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2); // output 200 100

      let name = "Wes";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2); // out put Wes Wes
      name = "Wesley";
      console.log(name, name2); // output Wesley Wes

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);
      // output the same array
      // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(players, team);
      // both arrays are changed to ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]
      // because they both reference back to the same array

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice(); // made a copy of the players array
      team2[3] = "Jon"; // changes are only made to the copy, not the original players array
      console.log(players, team, team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "James"; // changes are only made to the copy, not the original players array
      console.log(players, team, team2, team3);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "Alan"; // changes are only made to the copy, not the original players array
      console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "Ryan"; // changes are only made to the copy, not the original players array
      console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4, team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(person); // output person.number = 99

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // Object.assign, pass an empty object as the first argument
      // the object we want to make a copy of as the second argument
      // the properties we want to change as the third argument
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100, age: 12 });
      console.log(person, cap2); // changes are made only to cap2 in this case

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,

          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",

      dev.social.twitter = "@coolman";
      console.log(wes, dev); // both wes.social.twitter and dev.social twitter are changed
      // because Object.assign() only makes a one-level deep copy

      // JSON.stringify() turns the object into a string
      // JSON.parse immediately parse it into an object
      // need to think about performance before doing this
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
